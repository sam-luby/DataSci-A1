# DataSciPy-1

Data Science in Python assignment 1

Assignment was to find and use an API, process data, analyse data and make some conclusions etc.

I used a weather API (and some other APIs to help me) to pull forecasted weather information about 10 cities around the world. 

Some processing and analysing is done to find out various things (hottest upcoming day on avg among other stats).

Pandas and numpy, along with other python modules, are used.

I added 40 cities before graphing the mean high temperature per city vs the distance from the Earth's equator. This was to find out if there 
was a clear correlation between the two. 

Look at the python jupyter notebook (.ipynb to get the step-by-step process)
